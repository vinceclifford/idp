---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 16 or higher
- **Python** 3.8 or higher
- **PostgreSQL** running locally or remotely

---

## Setup

### 1. Database

Create a PostgreSQL database, then update the connection string in `backend/database.py`:

```python
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://<user>:<password>@localhost/<db_name>"
```

### 2. Backend

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Windows (PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary python-multipart pydantic

# Start the API server — run from inside the backend/ directory
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

API available at `http://localhost:8000`.
Interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### 3. Seed Data (optional but recommended)

Run these from inside the `backend/` directory (same as uvicorn):

```bash
cd backend
python seed_libraries.py
python seed_players.py
python seed_past_matches.py
```

### 4. Frontend

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

### 5. Create an Account

Open the app, go to the Login page, and use the **Register** option to create your first user.
Alternatively call `POST /register` via the interactive API docs at `/docs`.

## Feature Details

### Training Sessions

Sessions reference exercises from three library layers:
1. **Basics** - Fundamental concepts (optional diagram image)
2. **Principles** - Coaching philosophy (optional media upload)
3. **Tactics** - Tactical systems (optional diagram, suggested drills)

### Match & Lineup

- Create upcoming fixtures with opponent, date, time, and location.
- Drag and drop players onto a visual pitch using React DnD.
- Formation is auto-suggested from tactics used in training sessions within the last 7 days; defaults to 4-4-2 if none found.

### Authentication

Login and registration are handled by the FastAPI backend (`/login`, `/register`). On success the frontend stores an `isAuthenticated` flag in `localStorage` for session persistence across page reloads.

> **Security note:** Passwords are currently stored in plain text. Integrate a hashing library (e.g. `passlib[bcrypt]`) before any production deployment.

### Media Uploads

Images and videos can be attached to Basics, Principles, and Exercises. Files are uploaded via `POST /upload`, saved to `static/uploads/`, and served as static assets by FastAPI at `/static/uploads/<filename>`.

### Data Conventions

- Backend uses `snake_case`; frontend uses `camelCase`. Conversion helpers are in `src/lib/utils.ts`.
- Several fields (e.g. `selected_players`, `linked_tactics`) are stored as comma-separated strings in PostgreSQL and parsed on both sides.
